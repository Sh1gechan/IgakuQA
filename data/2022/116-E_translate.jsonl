Her current illness began two days ago when she developed a sore throat and a temperature in the 37-degree Celsius range. Her temperature elevated to 38.6 degrees Celsius yesterday in spite of taking an over-the-counter antipyretic agent. This morning her temperature decreased to 37.6 degrees Celsius, but her sore throat worsened. She reports no nasal congestion, cough, or sputum production. Her sore throat worsens with swallowing, but no difficulty swallowing has been experienced. She denies contact with others who have had similar symptoms. She reports a history of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis three years ago. She uses acetaminophen for menstrual cramps. She does not smoke, drinks alcohol occasionally, is a third-year university student involved in job hunting, does not have pets, and has not traveled abroad. She has no known allergies. She lives with her parents and her last menstrual period ended 7 days ago after lasting for 4 days. Her father has hypertension, and her mother and younger brother are healthy.\n\nDuring the current evaluation, she has a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, a pulse of 96 beats/minute, and a blood pressure of 108/62 mm Hg. The examination demonstrates no rash on the limbs or trunk. There is bilateral tonsillar erythema and enlargement with white exudate noted on the surface of both tonsils. She has palpable tender lymphadenopathy in both posterior cervical chains; three lymph nodes on each side are palpable, with the largest measuring 1 cm in diameter.

The abdomen is flat and soft, and the liver is palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, while the spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. There is no tenderness to percussion along the costovertebral angles. Laboratory evaluation shows a urine analysis with no protein, sugar, or blood and a negative leukocyte sediment. Blood examination demonstrated a red blood cell count of 4.1 million/μL, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 39%, and white blood cell count of 17,400/μL. Differential is as follows: segmented neutrophils 44%, eosinophils 1%, basophils 3%, lymphocytes 42%, and atypical lymphocytes 10%. Platelet count was 210,000/μL.
